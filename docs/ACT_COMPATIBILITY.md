# Act Workflow Compatibility Matrix

This document defines which GitHub Actions workflow jobs can run locally via [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) and which require native build hosts.

## Overview

**act** runs GitHub Actions locally in Docker containers. It supports `ubuntu-*` runners but cannot run `macos-*` or `windows-*` runners natively. For cross-platform builds, dsr uses:

- **act** (Linux/Docker): `ubuntu-*` jobs
- **mmini** (SSH): macOS native builds
- **wlap** (SSH): Windows native builds

## Runner Compatibility

| Runner | act Support | Native Host | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `ubuntu-latest` | Yes | - | Docker container |
| `ubuntu-22.04` | Yes | - | Docker container |
| `ubuntu-20.04` | Yes | - | Docker container |
| `macos-latest` | No | mmini | Requires Apple Silicon |
| `macos-14` | No | mmini | Requires Apple Silicon |
| `macos-13` | No | mmini | Intel or Rosetta |
| `windows-latest` | No | wlap | Requires Windows host |
| `windows-2022` | No | wlap | Requires Windows host |
| `self-hosted` + linux | Partial | varies | May need custom images |

## Tool Compatibility Matrix

## act Job Mapping

The `act_job_map` in repos.d/*.yaml maps target platforms to act jobs:

```yaml
act_job_map:
  linux/amd64: build-linux      # Runs via act
  linux/arm64: build-linux-arm  # Runs via act with QEMU
  darwin/arm64: null            # Native on mmini
  darwin/amd64: null            # Native on mmini (Rosetta)
  windows/amd64: null           # Native on wlap
```

- **Non-null values**: Job ID to run via act
- **null values**: Requires native build host (SSH)

## Per-Host Overrides

Different target platforms require different build strategies:

### linux/amd64 (trj - primary host)

Default act configuration. All Linux jobs run here via Docker.

```yaml
act_overrides:
  platform_image: catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
```

### linux/arm64 (trj via cross-compile or QEMU)

Two strategies for ARM64 Linux:

1. **Cross-compile** (preferred for Go/Rust):
   ```yaml
   cross_compile:
     linux/arm64:
       method: native  # Go
       env:
         GOOS: linux
         GOARCH: arm64
   ```

2. **QEMU emulation** (slower, full compatibility):
   ```yaml
   act_overrides:
     linux_arm64_flags:
       - "--container-architecture linux/arm64"
   ```

### darwin/arm64 (mmini)

Native builds via SSH. Required for macOS code signing.

```yaml
act_job_map:
  darwin/arm64: null  # Native build required

native_build:
  darwin/arm64:
    host: mmini
    connection: ssh
```

### windows/amd64 (wlap)

Native builds via SSH. Required for Windows code signing.

```yaml
act_job_map:
  windows/amd64: null  # Native build required

native_build:
  windows/amd64:
    host: wlap
    connection: ssh
```

## Common act Flags

| Flag | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `-j <job>` | Run specific job | `-j build-linux` |
| `-W <workflow>` | Specify workflow file | `-W .github/workflows/release.yml` |
| `--artifact-server-path` | Artifact output | `--artifact-server-path /tmp/artifacts` |
| `-P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest` | Custom image | Platform override |
| `--matrix key:value` | Filter job matrix to a specific value | `--matrix os:ubuntu-latest --matrix target:linux/amd64` |
| `--env-file` | Environment variables | `--env-file .env.act` |
| `-s GITHUB_TOKEN` | Pass secrets | `-s GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `-e <event.json>` | Event payload | `-e event.json` |

## Known Limitations

### Jobs That Cannot Run in act

1. **macOS code signing**: Requires real macOS for codesign
2. **Windows native compilation**: MSVC, .NET Framework
3. **Docker-in-Docker**: Some act images have limited Docker support
4. **Hardware-specific tests**: GPU, network interfaces
5. **Service containers**: May need manual setup

### Workarounds

1. **Cross-compilation**: Use cargo-zigbuild for Windows/ARM targets on Linux
2. **Matrix splitting**: Separate Linux jobs from macOS/Windows in workflow
3. **Environment variables**: `ACT=true` to detect act environment

## Workflow Best Practices

### Separating Runners

```yaml
jobs:
  build-linux:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # ... (act compatible)

  build-macos:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    # ... (requires native)

  build-windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    # ... (requires native)
```

### Matrix Filtering for Targeted Builds

If your release job uses a build matrix (single job with multiple platform entries), dsr can
filter the matrix values it passes to act. Add `act_matrix` per target in your repo config:

```yaml
act_matrix:
  "linux/amd64":
    os: ubuntu-latest
    target: linux/amd64
```

dsr will pass each key/value as `--matrix key:value` when invoking act for that target.

### Detecting act Environment

```yaml
- name: Check if running in act
  if: ${{ env.ACT }}
  run: echo "Running in act"
```

### Artifact Naming for Multi-Platform

```yaml
- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: ${{ matrix.binary_name }}-${{ matrix.target }}
    path: target/release/${{ matrix.binary_name }}
```

## Using the Compatibility Matrix

The `act_runner.sh` module provides functions to query the compatibility matrix:

```bash
source src/act_runner.sh

# Load a tool's configuration
act_load_repo_config ntm
# → [act] Loaded config for ntm: Dicklesworthstone/ntm

# Get the job to run for a platform
act_get_job_for_target ntm linux/amd64
# → build

act_get_job_for_target ntm darwin/arm64
# → (empty - native build required)

# Check if a platform uses act or native
act_platform_uses_act ntm linux/amd64 && echo "act" || echo "native"
# → act

act_platform_uses_act ntm darwin/arm64 && echo "act" || echo "native"
# → native

# Get the build strategy for a platform
act_get_build_strategy ntm linux/amd64
# → {"tool":"ntm","platform":"linux/amd64","method":"act","host":"trj","job":"build"}

act_get_build_strategy cass darwin/arm64
# → {"tool":"cass","platform":"darwin/arm64","method":"native","host":"mmini","job":""}

# Get all targets for a tool
act_get_targets ntm
# → linux/amd64 linux/arm64 darwin/arm64 darwin/amd64 windows/amd64

# List all configured tools
act_list_tools
# → br bv cass ntm

# Generate full build matrix
act_build_matrix ntm | jq .
# → [{"tool":"ntm","platform":"linux/amd64","method":"act",...}, ...]
```

## Testing act Compatibility

Use dsr's built-in analysis:

```bash
# Analyze a workflow
dsr check --analyze-workflow /path/to/repo/.github/workflows/release.yml

# Test run a specific job
act -j build-linux -W .github/workflows/release.yml --dryrun
```
