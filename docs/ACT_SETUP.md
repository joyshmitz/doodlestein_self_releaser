# nektos/act Setup for dsr

`act` allows running GitHub Actions workflows locally in Docker containers. dsr uses act to build Linux targets when GitHub Actions is throttled.

## Installation

### macOS (Homebrew)
```bash
brew install act
```

### Linux (Go)
```bash
go install github.com/nektos/act@latest
```

### Linux (Nix)
```bash
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.act
```

### Linux (Binary)
```bash
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

## Initial Configuration

On first run, act prompts for default runner image. Select based on your needs:

| Choice | Image | Size | Use Case |
|--------|-------|------|----------|
| Large | `catthehacker/ubuntu:full-*` | ~12GB | Full compatibility (recommended) |
| Medium | `catthehacker/ubuntu:act-*` | ~500MB | Good balance |
| Micro | `node:16-buster-slim` | ~200MB | Node-only workflows |

For dsr, use **Large** for maximum compatibility with complex workflows.

## ~/.actrc Configuration

Create `~/.actrc` for consistent behavior. **The easiest way:**

```bash
cp /path/to/dsr/config/actrc.example ~/.actrc
```

Or create manually:

```bash
# Default runner images (pin for reproducibility)
-P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:full-22.04
-P ubuntu-22.04=catthehacker/ubuntu:full-22.04
-P ubuntu-20.04=catthehacker/ubuntu:full-20.04

# Architecture settings
--container-architecture linux/amd64

# Bind mount for faster file access
--bind

# CRITICAL: Prevent UID mismatch!
# catthehacker images run as UID 1001 (user "runner")
# Without this, files created by act will have wrong ownership
--container-options --user=1000:1000

# Artifact collection
--artifact-server-path /tmp/dsr-act-artifacts
```

> **CRITICAL: The `--user` Line**
>
> Replace `1000:1000` with your actual UID:GID. Find yours with:
> ```bash
> id -u   # Your UID (usually 1000 on single-user systems)
> id -g   # Your GID (usually 1000)
> ```
>
> Without this line, **all files created by act will be owned by UID 1001**, making them inaccessible to your normal user. This breaks:
> - Git operations (permission denied on .git files)
> - Build tools (can't write to target directories)
> - Other processes accessing the same directories
>
> **Always run `dsr doctor` after configuration to verify.**

## Verifying Your Configuration

```bash
# Check actrc is properly configured
dsr doctor

# Should show:
#   actrc: configured correctly (--bind with --user)

# If you see this error, your actrc needs the --user line:
#   actrc: CRITICAL - --bind without --user flag
```

## Platform Mapping

| Workflow `runs-on` | dsr Action |
|-------------------|------------|
| `ubuntu-latest` | Run via act on css |
| `ubuntu-*` | Run via act on css |
| `macos-*` | Native SSH to mmini |
| `windows-*` | Native SSH to wlap |
| `self-hosted` | Check labels, route accordingly |

## Common act Commands

### List workflows and jobs
```bash
act -l                              # List all workflows/jobs
act -l -W .github/workflows/ci.yml  # List jobs in specific workflow
```

### Run specific workflow/job
```bash
act -W .github/workflows/release.yml           # Run release workflow
act -j build-linux -W .github/workflows/release.yml  # Run specific job
```

### Dry-run mode
```bash
act -n -W .github/workflows/release.yml        # Show what would run
```

### Event simulation
```bash
act push                            # Simulate push event
act workflow_dispatch               # Simulate manual trigger
act release -e event.json           # Simulate release with payload
```

### Secrets and environment
```bash
act --secret-file .secrets          # Load secrets from file
act -s GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN   # Pass specific secret
act --env-file .env                 # Load environment variables
```

### Offline mode (after images cached)
```bash
act --pull=false --action-offline-mode
```

### Artifact collection
```bash
act --artifact-server-path /tmp/artifacts
# Artifacts appear in /tmp/artifacts/<run-id>/
```

## dsr Integration

dsr wraps act with additional features:

1. **Auto-detection**: Parses workflow files to identify targets
2. **Routing**: Sends Linux to act, macOS/Windows to native SSH
3. **Artifact collection**: Consolidates artifacts from all sources
4. **Logging**: Structured logs with timing and error tracking

### dsr build flow (Linux via act)

```
dsr build --repo ntm --targets linux/amd64
    │
    ├─→ Parse .github/workflows/release.yml
    ├─→ Identify Linux jobs (runs-on: ubuntu-*)
    ├─→ Run: act -j build-linux -W .github/workflows/release.yml
    ├─→ Collect artifacts from act artifact server
    └─→ Sign artifacts, generate checksums
```

## Troubleshooting

### Files owned by wrong user (UID 1001)

**Symptom:** After running act, some files are owned by user ID 1001 instead of your user:

```bash
$ ls -la
drwx------ 1001 1001 310 Jan 31 14:24 .beads
-rw-r--r-- 1001 1001 4.0K Jan 25 16:18 some_file
```

**Cause:** The catthehacker runner images run as UID 1001 (user "runner"). When act bind-mounts your repo (`--bind`), files created inside the container get UID 1001 ownership.

**Fix:**

1. Add user mapping to `~/.actrc`:
   ```bash
   echo '--container-options --user=$(id -u):$(id -g)' >> ~/.actrc
   ```

2. Fix existing files:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $(id -un):$(id -gn) /path/to/repo
   ```

3. Verify the fix:
   ```bash
   dsr doctor
   # Should show: actrc: configured correctly (--bind with --user)
   ```

**Prevention:** Always use the example config:
```bash
cp /path/to/dsr/config/actrc.example ~/.actrc
```

### "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker info
# On Linux, add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

### "Image pull failed"
```bash
# Pre-pull images
docker pull catthehacker/ubuntu:full-22.04
# Or use offline mode after first run
act --pull=false
```

### "Container architecture mismatch"
```bash
# Force amd64 on ARM hosts
act --container-architecture linux/amd64
```

### "Action not found"
```bash
# Some actions need network; disable offline for first run
act --action-offline-mode=false
```

### "Resource exhausted"
```bash
# Increase Docker resources or use smaller image
act -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-22.04
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Pre-pull images**: Run `docker pull` for runner images before heavy use
2. **Use --pull=false**: Skip image check after first successful run
3. **Cache actions**: Enable `--action-offline-mode` after actions are cached
4. **SSD storage**: Docker storage on SSD significantly improves build times
5. **Parallel jobs**: act respects `jobs.*.needs`, runs independent jobs in parallel
